## 2025-03-25 - Whiptail Checklists lack visual cues for keyboard interactions
**Learning:** CLI UI frameworks like whiptail often lack intuitive visual cues for their keyboard interactions. For example, many users don't realize they must press `<Space>` to toggle items in a `--checklist` before pressing `<Enter>`, leading them to accidentally skip all selections.
**Action:** Always include explicit, inline keyboard instructions (like `(Press <Space> to toggle, <Enter> to confirm)`) in the prompt or title of CLI interactive menus that rely on specific keystrokes.

## 2025-03-25 - Handle Empty States in CLI Prompts
**Learning:** When prompting users to select from a dynamic list in CLI scripts, displaying the prompt when the list is empty creates a confusing and broken user experience.
**Action:** Always check if a dynamic list is empty before prompting the user to select from it. If it is empty, exit gracefully and provide actionable instructions on how to populate the list instead of showing a non-functional prompt.

## 2023-11-20 - [Distinguishing cancellation from empty selection]
**Learning:** In interactive CLI prompts using `whiptail`, treating an empty checklist submission the same as a manual cancellation (`ESC`/`Cancel`) leads to misleading warnings ("Selection cancelled.") or treats intentional skips as errors.
**Action:** Always intercept the exit code of `whiptail` explicitly. If it returns non-zero, it was cancelled, so log properly and return early. If it returns 0 but the selection is empty, treat it as a successful intentional skip.

## 2025-03-25 - CLI Prompt Standardization
**Learning:** Raw `read -p` and `printf` prompts without visual distinction blend in with terminal output, causing users to miss the prompt or get confused about what input is expected. This reduces parsing speed and accessibility.
**Action:** Standardize interactive CLI prompt styling across the application using a dedicated helper function (like `log_ask`) that provides consistent, recognizable visual cues (e.g., a colored `[?]` prefix).

## 2025-03-25 - Prevent UI Hangs in Non-Interactive Shell Environments
**Learning:** Shell scripts using standard terminal inputs like `read -r` will hang indefinitely when executed in non-interactive CI/CD or headless environments. Attempting to fall back directly to interactive prompts when higher-level tools like `whiptail` fail causes automation pipelines to block.
**Action:** When implementing custom interactive prompts or fallbacks, always include a guard clause at the beginning of the function (`if [[ ! -t 0 ]]; then ...`) to detect non-interactive environments. In these cases, gracefully log a warning and safely bypass the `read` operation by returning immediately or applying safe, deterministic defaults.
